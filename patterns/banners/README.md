Each banner shows humans and dogs interacting. Each banner needs to be beautiful and emotional, and sells a connection to the user that makes them want to adopt. Every image in the banner creates a personal connection with the user on the website.

Each banner is used at the top of the page, with a different image and quote on different pages. The quotes vary, but are meant to be funny and cute.
