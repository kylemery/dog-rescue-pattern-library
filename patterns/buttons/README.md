The buttons use the secondary colour as well as our brand gradient to stand out and also to draw attention to the user while matching the rest of the site.

- The regular buttons are for important links and for standing out. They are for any colour background except purple.
- The light buttons are for purple or dark background.
- The ghost buttons are only used for banners and places with large photography.

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size' classes to make different sized buttons but  make sure they're not too big.
